    "Imagine you are organizing a party and you have a list of guests. However, you want to filter out some guests based on certain criteria. In this case, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is like your method of filtering out guests who don't meet the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a list of positive integers representing your guests' ages. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm helps you identify which guests should be \"erased\" or removed from the list based on a specific rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the Sieve of Eratosthenes, you start by assuming that all guests are potential candidates and mark them as \"eligible\" by default. Then, you iterate through the list, starting from the first eligible guest (number 2), and follow a specific rule to determine if they should be erased or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine each guest as a number written on a name tag.\n",
    "You start with the first eligible guest (number 2) and keep them in the guest list.\n",
    "Now, you go to each subsequent guest (number 3, 4, 5, and so on) and check if they have already been erased by another guest.\n",
    "If a guest has not been erased yet, you keep them in the guest list and proceed to erase all their multiples.\n",
    "For example, if guest number 2 is still in the list, you erase all the multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8, and so on) from the list since they have already been \"erased\" by guest number 2.\n",
    "Then, you move to the next eligible guest (number 3) and repeat the process. If they haven't been erased yet, you keep them in the list and erase their multiples.\n",
    "You continue this process until you reach the end of the list or until you have erased enough guests based on your criteria.\n",
    "In the given problem, you are asked to find the Kth number to be erased from the guest list. You start applying the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm until you have erased K numbers. If K is greater than the number of erased guests, you output 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if N is 15 and K is 8, you follow the erasing order: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 9, 15. Here, guest number 12 has already been erased by guest number 2, so it is not counted as a number erased by guest number 3. Therefore, the 8th number to be erased is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem using code, you can use the provided code snippet as a starting point. The find_primes function implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm by creating a sieve list where eligible numbers are marked as 1 and non-eligible numbers are marked as 0. Then, it iterates through the sieve list to find Kth erased number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call this function with your desired values of N and K to find the Kth erased number. If K is greater than the number of erased guests, it will return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this analogy helps you understand how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works and how it can be applied to solve your problem!"

    "Goldbach's Conjecture: Any even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "According to Goldbach's weak conjecture, any odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers. At this time, if a triangle can be created with these three prime numbers, let's call this triangle a Goldbach triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if N = 7, N = 2 + 2 + 3, then N can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers (2, 2, 3). Therefore, we can create a Goldbach triangle with three sides of 2, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if N = 9, N = 2 + 2 + 5, it can be expressed as three prime numbers (2, 2, 5). However, since a triangle cannot be created with numbers whose three sides are 2, 2, and 5, respectively, a Goldbach triangle cannot be created. Instead, since N = 3 + 3 + 3, we can create a Goldbach triangle with sides of 3, 3, and 3, respectively.\n",

    "magine you are a treasure hunter, and you have a special map that leads you to hidden treasures. However, this map comes with a rule: to find the treasure, you need to combine the powers of two other treasure hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goldbach Conjecture is similar to this treasure hunt. It suggests that any even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, if the even number is 10, you can find the treasure by combining the powers of two prime numbers, such as 3 and 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about the Weak Goldbach Conjecture. It states that any odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers. In our treasure hunting analogy, this means that to find the treasure for an odd number, you need the combined powers of three prime number hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the odd number is 9, you can still find the treasure by combining the powers of three prime number hunters, like 3, 3, and 3. However, not all odd numbers can form a \"Goldbach triangle,\" which is our term for a valid combination of three prime numbers that forms a triangle. For example, with the odd number 9, although you can combine the powers of prime number hunters 2, 2, and 5, they cannot form a triangle. But don't worry, you can still form a Goldbach triangle with three prime number hunters who all have a power of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you have a list of odd numbers greater than 5. Your task is to count how many different Goldbach triangles you can form with these odd numbers. Remember, we count them as one even if they have the same combination of prime number hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use an algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It's like having a magical device that helps us quickly identify all prime number hunters up to a certain limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a list of potential prime number hunters and mark them all as \"potential primes.\" Then we start from the first potential prime number hunter and check if they are still marked as \"potential primes.\" If they are, we know they are prime number hunters and can add them to our list of confirmed prime number hunters. We also mark all their multiples as \"not prime\" since they are already claimed by the confirmed prime number hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we finish this process for all potential prime number hunters, we have our list of confirmed prime number hunters up to a certain limit.\n",

To help Euler's younger brother, the teacher wrote two three-digit positive integers on the blackboard. Then he asked Euler's younger brother which number was larger. However, he does not read the numbers starting from the leftmost digit. He read the numbers from the rightmost digit to the left. And he proudly told the teacher the largest number of the two. Find the number that Euler's brother said.\n",
