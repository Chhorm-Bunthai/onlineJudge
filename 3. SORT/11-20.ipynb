    "## A Magic Wand\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Harry Potter's wand was damaged while fighting Lord Voldemort. So Harry Potter decided to purchase a new wand at Ollivander's Wand Shop with Euler. Ollivander's Wand Shop has N magic wands and N wand boxes. The lengths of the wands are, respectively, X1, X2, … , Xn, and the box sizes are Y1, Y2, … , Yn. A wand of length X can be placed in a box of size Y if X ≤ Y. Since a box can only hold one wand, Harry wants to know whether each box can hold all of the wands. Help Harry solve this difficult problem.\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "In the first line, a single positive integer N (1≤N≤100) is given, representing the number of wands and boxes. In the second line, N positive integers Xi(1≤Xi≤10^9) is given, representing the length of the wands.In the third line, N positive integers Yi(1≤Yi≤10^9) is given, representing the size of the box.\n",

    "AnB Game Company is in big trouble. Although the company's new game has been a huge success, the number of new users has plummeted these days. The problem was that the stage difference between new users and existing users was too big.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several meetings to solve this problem, it was decided to adjust the difficulty by dynamically increasing the game time.Most of the logic was easily implemented, leaving only the part that calculates the failure rate. Complete the code to calculate the failure rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure rate is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of players who have reached the stage but have not yet cleared it / Number of players who have reached and cleared the stage\n",
    "\n",
    "When the total number of stages N, an array stages containing the number of the stage where the user using the game is currently stopped, are given as parameters, complete the solution function to return an array containing the number of the stages in descending order from the stage with the highest failure rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of stages N is a natural number from 1 to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The length of the stages is between 1 and 200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stages contain natural numbers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to N + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each natural number indicates the number of the stage the user is currently challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, N + 1 indicates the user who cleared up to the last stage (Nth stage).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there are stages with the same failure rate, the stage with the smaller number should come first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If no user reaches a stage, the failure rate for that stage is defined as 0.\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "- In the first line, the number of stages N is given as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the second line, each element of the stage array containing the number of the stage where the user is currently playing the game is separated by a single space.\n",
